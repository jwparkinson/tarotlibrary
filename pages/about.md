## About the Collection  
While many collectors of Tarot cards do so because of their purported supernatural abilities, as far as modern science can tell they're little more than ordinary playing cards. This does not, however, detract from the beauty of Tarot decks; unlike most standard 52-card decks, each Tarot card contains a detailed illustration, often playing off of age-old symbolism and parable. This collection showcases just a few of those cards, pulling six Major Arcana from decks varying in both art style and age.

You can search the collection by card title, deck title, artist, date, subject, suit, or description. You can also browse the full collection and sort it alphabetically, by date, by suit, or by deck; or click the buttons below each card to view other cards with the same tag. The purpose of this collection is to show how different artists, separated by time, gender, and culture, each interprets the centuries-old format of Tarot.
